To install, use the normal configure/build cycle (see .configure --help for all options):

unpack the tarball with tar(8)

./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
make install
make clean


To install the files in a different directory, the normal DESTDIR variable is supported.
This is us useful for most package-systems. IE:

make install DESTDIR=$RPM_BUILD_ROOT
