XMLReports is a fork of webalizer, our favorite web-analysis software.

The difference is that XMLReports only outputs XML-files (no PNG Charts, no HTML),
which makes the output highly customizable.

Also we have introduced a new switch (-z URI), which adds a XSL stylesheet header in the XML-files.
Most browsers support XSL Transformation, so one use could be to have the browser transform the XML 
into HTML directly.

As another example of use, could be to have a crontab calling "xsltproc", that mails out montly reports
in a format suited for mail.

For instructions about installing, see the file named INSTALL.
