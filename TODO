TODO:
		- remove HTML stuff from xmloutput.c (write and test xml-stuff as nessesary)
		- implement all functions as of webalizer with default patchset (make sure dns, geoip etc. works).
		- add more tests in configure.in
		- figure out what to do with stylesheets (cmd/config parameter?)
		- make more usable xml structure
		- add versions from autoconf in webalizer.h
		- add stylesheet to config-file

IDEAS:
        - look at features from other webalizer forks (stone steps, etc)
        - implement a xmlwriting class
